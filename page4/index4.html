        <p>Now that the world has become a global village, Kanchipuram sarees are available the world over. However, the production of these beautiful sarees is still centred in Kanchipuram, a small town located on the Palar river in South India. Also called Kanchi, the town is renowned for its silk industry and its temples.We use cookies for a better user experience. By continuing to browse this site, you agree to its cookie policy and can decide to change your browser settings anytime.The origin of the Kanchipuram saree dates back to centuries ago when these sarees used to be woven in temples. Kanchipuram sarees, woven from pure mulberry silk, are found in myriad colours.</p> 
        <p>  These sarees have borders and pallu in a contrasting colour with heavy gold weaving. Kanchipuram sarees traditionally had designs representing simple gold lines or gold dots. The designs on these sarees were inspired by the designs in South Indian temples or natural elements like birds, leaves, etc. Some of the best-known patterns in Kanchipuram saree borders are Rudraksham (representing Rudraksha beads), Gopuram (representing temples), Mayilkan (Peacock eye) and Kuyilkan(Nightingaleâ€™s eye). Keeping in view the changing trends, Kanchipuram silk sarees have undergone a transformation. Even Kanchipuram designer silk sarees are available, with embroidery or crystal work done on the traditional silk saree. One of the latest trends in these sarees is using ancient paintings and the images of gods and goddesses in the pallu.In an authentic Kanchipuram silk saree, the body of the saree and the pallu are woven separately and then stitched together.
